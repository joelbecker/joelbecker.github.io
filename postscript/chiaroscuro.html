        <p>My CAFKA artist page talks about how my zine project celebrates &#34;happy accidents&#34; in art, since chance and experimentation are important to the visual mediums that I enjoy working in like glitch art, scanography, collage, and video synthesis. But Chiaroscuro in the Age of Data came about entirely as a happy accident, as artistic experiences that had stayed with me for a decade happened to collide with my current interest in a critical and intentional approach to technology use.</p>
    </div>
</section><section class="wrapper style1 align-center" id="section2">
    <div class="inner">
        <p>The happy accident started because I had bought a photo printer that I wanted to test. I was browsing around WikiMedia Commons for public domain images when I came across this painting. I was absolutely entranced by it - both by the drama and the tragedy but also by the level of detail and precision in the painting.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>The use of chiaroscuro, and the stark contrast of beauty and destruction, reminded me of a collage I had made visualizing the interplay of light and darkness in technology. I spent some time writing and reflecting on this connection, and that eventually became the seed of the zine.</p>

        <p>However, the happy accidents did not stop there. I didn&#39;t expect that reflection to connect back to my experience with An Experiment with an Air Pump, which turned out to be extremely poignant to consider as society grapples (perhaps more than usual) with the consequences of technological advancement. That flowed naturally into the story of the Luddites, and so on.</p>

        <p>I am glad that the Luddites made an appearance in this zine, since my entire practice of creating &#34;micro-zines&#34; was initially a way of working up to a larger-format zine series called &#34;the Luddite&#34; that I had been developing but was struggling to coalesce.</p>
    </div>
</section><section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="section6">
    <div class="content">
        <p>But the core thesis of the Luddite was meant to be that we should not be afraid to reject technology when it does not serve us; that we should not be afraid to reject capitalism when it does not serve us; and that we should not be afraid to share art (when we can) in ways that challenge the hold of both these forces upon our lives.</p>

    <div class="inner">
        <p>The thing that made finishing the Luddite feel like a task that was too large to take on was that the first volume was manifesto to artistic values which felt sacred and necessary to me - but that ultimately I was afraid I couldn&#39;t live up to with the purity I articulated them in the invocation I had written. But I&#39;m now realizing that while I never found the courage to publish the manifesto as I&#39;d written it - I have ended up acting it out quite faithfully by using zines as a way to share my art, in real world spaces, with people in my community, without the pressure of monetization. So perhaps the Luddite came to be after all - in actions rather than words.</p>
