        <p>I find digital footprints to be fascinating, and I have many ambitious ideas in note pages (that will in all likelihood stay there, as note pages are wont to do) for systems of collecting them and exploring them. My favourite of these ideas is a calendar of Insignificant Events, which collects a daily record of digital footprints in time. (It&#39;s a play on my Dad&#39;s practice of keeping a &#34;Significant Events&#34; calendar for our family - but while our digital history might be significant collectively, that name didn&#39;t feel appropriate.) To this end I&#39;ve collected data export requests from many technology platforms, hoping that someday I&#39;ll do something interesting with my music streaming history, my chat history, and whatnot. But as I have found repeatedly (including in my &#34;oldest file&#34; escapade) is that often times problems that feel like they need a tool are actually in need of our attention, care, and reflection. So I hope that when I do explore those things, I do so with presence, and write code only when truly necessary.</p>

        <p>P.P.S. The first image in the zine is a screenshot of Pokemon Emerald exactly as it loaded from my save file from who-knows-when. Digital footprints come in many forms.</p>

        <p>It was interesting to think about all the Pokémon in various memory chips that I&#39;ve trained over the years, and how underneath the cute graphics they are 1s and 0s and data structures just like Karl1.bmp and just like my advertising profile in the seemingly all-seeing-eyes of the attention merchants.</p>

        <p>But one of the thing I hope you take away from Digital Ephemera is to remember that digital footprints only record the steps we take as digital entities -and no matter how we document our lives, the most important parts can only stay with us to the extent we experience them and reflect on them.</p>
