        <p>If you&#39;ve never tried scan art, I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough. It is perhaps the lowest barrier to entry of any form of visual art (or was, until everyone had a camera in their pocket.) It&#39;s popular for this reason, and scanography is sometimes seen as an artistic cliché. But I&#39;ve found it to be a really interesting medium to explore deeply. I love scan art as an artistic processes because it gives rapid feedback, encourages exploration, and creates space for happy accidents. But as a cheeky nod to scan art&#39;s reputation, I had originally included the glitched text &#34;everybody&#39;s favourite low-effort art form&#34; in the collage cover of this zine. I still think it&#39;s a funny joke, but the more I thought about it the more I felt it unintentionally devalued the hours I&#39;ve spent working with my scanner, the difficulty of tweaking your process to iterate on the result, and the important work of curating the result. In the end, I cut out the words with a craft knife and filled it in with another scan. I don&#39;t regret it — creativity thrives in humour, but it&#39;s easy to lean on self-deprecation as to deflect real or imagined judgement. And as I&#39;ve said in other zines and reflections, part of the journey of an artist is staying with your enthusiasms even when your deepest instinct is to hide them away.</p>
