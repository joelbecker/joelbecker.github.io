        <p>Take Nothing, Leave Everything is by far the most vulnerable piece in this zine collection. I find poetry fundamentally more vulnerable than prose in the same way that I find singing fundamentally more vulnerable than playing an instrument. But the real reason is that these poems are a directly look into my journal at what I&#39;ve come to see as a formative moment in my life - that&#39;s a privilege I&#39;ve so far given to only a handful of confidants, and it took a lot of courage to publish these for unknown eyes, who might just as easily judge or dismiss as accept and reflect.</p>

        <p>I made the difficult decision to let the poems stand on their own, rather than telling the story of writing them. But I&#39;m glad to explore it here in the postscript, where I can also reflect on how writing these poems influenced by creative practice.</p>

        <p>I wrote these poems on a solo camping trip I took to escape the city and reconnect with nature. I had just finished setting up camp, and I was about to turn off my phone - to me, a vital part of being in the forest. Without thinking, I moved to take a picture, thinking that I would post a picture to instagram before turning off my phone. But I stopped myself - if I was really here to disconnect, why would I document the experience for the internet? I turned off my phone, took out a blank journal I had brought, and started writing: &#34;take nothing but pictures? even this is far too much...&#34;.</p>

        <p>This was far from the first time I had created boundaries from technology: but it stands out to me because it was the first time I remember that doing so felt like an act of resistance reclaiming ground in a battle that I was losing. It was also the first time resisting social media had entered my creative practice.</p>
    </div>
</section><section class="wrapper style1 align-center" id="section5">
    <div class="inner">
        <p>This was partially because I hadn&#39;t yet found ways for my creativity to thrive in the city, since leaving behind the contexts of school and summer camp where creative exploration had come naturally to me as a student and camp counsellor. I had joined the corporate workforce a few years prior, I was no longer spending summers in the forest, and social media was becoming a bigger drain on my own attention and the world&#39;s.</p>

        <p>It wasn&#39;t until the pandemic when I started discovering new creative outlets that thrived in my life after camp: my creative habits quite directly emerged out of digital burnout during lockdown. And the more that I develop my creative practice, the more that I look back and see the seeds of it when I chose to leave my Silent Lake campsite in analogue anonymity.</p>

        <p>The third poem in this zine is much older: an assignment for a high school writing class that I&#39;ve remained quite fond of. But it&#39;s hard to articulate the strangeness of looking back at myself wax eloquent on the loss of innocent freedom, from I time before I had to pay rent, before I cooked for myself, before I had performance reviews instead of report cards, and before I was losing a battle with the attention merchants for the precious moments of my existence.</p>

        <p>But I&#39;m glad that as a teenager I was learning how art could be used to create perspective on my life. And I&#39;m glad that habit stayed with me long enough to survive the journey to Silent Lake, and everywhere it&#39;s taken me since.</p>

        <p>P.P.S. On the subject of &#34;happy accidents&#34;, this is one of the first mixtapes I made in lockdown as a way to escape my phone, both to create the mixtape and to listen to it. The mixtape is based on the driving playlist I made for my trip to Silent Lake (the highlight being Theo Katzman&#39;s Country Backroads: &#34;I was driving, driving, driving, and I \ Lost my cell phone&#34;). The collage was a reflection on the trip - &#34;the urban&#34; turned upside down, roadways, waterways, and leaving the city behind. I felt a map would be visually appropriate, as was looking through an old Canadiana magazine when I found this one: a map including the literal route I had driven listening to the mix on the road to Silent Lake. That route is highlighted in red.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve always loved the serendipity of that mixtape. But it hadn&#39;t quite connected until I started this zine how that trip had also led to the taking and leaving poems, and the ripples it continues to have in my life.</p>
