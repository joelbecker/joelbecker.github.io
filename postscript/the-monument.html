        <p>There&#39;s a certain continuity between The Monument zine and Digital Ephemera, another in this collection, in that both are exploring the ways that digital footprints stay with us through our lives. My original voice note that The Monument is based on was itself a piece of digital ephemera, that stayed with me as I moved my files from phone to phone, computer to computer, of the course of my life. In a time when the eyes of the internet feel impossible to escape, it&#39;s easy to forget how much care an attention is required for recording the past, even the digital past. I&#39;m glad I put in that work to bring that voice note with me long enough to explore it and reclaim it. But The Monument also reminds me that recording the past is well and good, but digital and physical ephemera are only as special as the experiences they accompany. Singing in the monument was a truly special experience - I have a debt and an aspiration towards my younger self&#39;s willingness to leave the safety of the group and create such a moment.</p>
