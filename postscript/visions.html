        <p>Visions of Entropy is a zine I&#39;ve wanted to write for a long time. The idea came from a book on my shelf called Visions of Symmetry, about M.C. Escher&#39;s tessellations. At that point I was already deep into scanography and video synthesis, and was starting to dabble in analogue glitch art. It struck me that glitch art was the opposite of tessellation - finding aesthetics in disorder rather than order.</p>

        <p>At the same time, I was exploring online communities devoted to glitch art, and enjoyed seeing the trippy visuals showing up in my social media feeds. But glitch art (as I was experiencing it) was a feed of interesting visual stimuli. And so my initial idea was to use the question &#34;what does glitch art mean?&#34; as a way to approach glitch visuals while also feeling like it was &#34;serious art&#34; rather than aesthetic novelty.</p>

        <p>But the deeper I got into the process of writing Visions of Entropy, the more aware I was that I had come to the project from a place of defensiveness (perhaps even a place of judgement) that deserved interrogation.</p>

        <p>There were a lot of reasons why this zine was the most difficult create project I&#39;ve undergone in a very long time. Despite being the &#34;keystone&#34; of my public zine library project it was the only zine in the series that wasn&#39;t already done, or presenting a previous creative project through the medium of zines. But even without that pressure, the defensive posture that had led me to the question made it very difficult to write. The writing that eventually became the core of the zine was originally going to be a series of vignettes after a mini-essay motivating why the question &#34;what does glitch art mean&#34; needed to be asked. But the zine became much better (and much easier to write) once I gave myself permission to let the question stand on its own — and let myself ask if it was even the right question.</p>

        <p>This zine has a very clear mapping onto the CAFKA exhibition&#39;s &#34;Stay With Me&#34; theme, in the way that it uses the visual language of impermanence to look both forward and backward at what stays with us and the impermanence of life and memory. But reflecting on this piece now, I can see that my experience of it is much closer to the themes I explore in The Monument, or, Reclaiming My Mortification: staying with ourselves in our creative vulnerability even when our instinct is to judge, gate-keep, and diminish.</p>
