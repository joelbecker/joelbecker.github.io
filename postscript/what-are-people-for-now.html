        <p>Many of my zines, from Digital Ephemera to The Monument, explore themes of digital footprints and how they stay with us. This theme exists implicitly in any discussion of artificial intelligence, since the capacity of these systems is derived from the aggregation of a generation&#39;s worth of digital life.</p>

        <p>This zine was a joy to make, even if there&#39;s a kind of creeping unease that can&#39;t be ignored in any discussion of AI. But as I searched WikiMedia Commons for public domain images of robots, I found that the category was inundated with obviously mid-tier generative AI art. All of these images had timestamps like &#34;October 2022&#34;. It made me think that already in the present, and likely to an increasing degree in the future, the only way to be confident an illustration was made by a human would be to filter for results from 2021 and before. That&#39;s an uncomfortable thought.</p>

        <p>This zine is the only significant creative project I&#39;ve used an AI for - as many content creators have found, one of AI&#39;s most convenient uses is to provoke commentary about itself. I mostly forego AI visuals not to make an ethical stand (although the ethical concerns are grave) and not because I think AI art is inherently worthless (there are many creatives who use it to create things far more interesting than the low-value novelty of masterpiece-soup.) But life is short, and it&#39;s important to focus on expressing the ideas and visual styles that feel uniquely mine - and I haven&#39;t found AI to be helpful in that goal.</p>

        <p>The reality and conversation surrounding AI tools has evolved very fast - and I&#39;ve found it challenging to write about AI and still agree with myself months later. I noticed this when revising another zine, Chiaroscuro in the Age of Data, for the Stay With Me exhibition. I had originally written that &#34;The 21st century condition is to feel acutely how little we as individuals (and even as societies) control how technology changes and how technology changes us.&#34; It took me a long time to figure out how to express that sentiment without abdicating our agency in society to technological inevitability, and eventually changed it to &#34;The 21st century condition is to feel acutely how difficult it is for individuals (and even societies) to control how technology changes and how technology changes us. We feel the goodness of it and the badness of it pull on us like riptides.&#34; Like a riptide, technology and the stories we tell about it are powerful and can easy sweep us away. Navigating great changes at a societal level is never easy, and we have more power to shape the future than we think - for good and for ill.</p>
